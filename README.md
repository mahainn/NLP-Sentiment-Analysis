# NLP-Sentiment-Analysis
In this repo, we are basically working on Sentiment Analysis on tweets 
Working on a database with 14 different labelled emotions using sequence models (LSTM)
Before modelling, we will clean the data, perform pre-processing and word embedding using Glove.
For the multi-class model, we have used LSTM (Long Short Term Memory), a special Recurring Neural Network.
