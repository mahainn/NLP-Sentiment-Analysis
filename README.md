# NLP-Sentiment-Analysis
In this repo, we are basically working on Sentiment Analysis on tweets 
Working on a database with 13 different labelled emotions using sequence models (LSTM)
Before modelling, we will clean the data, perform pre-processing and word embedding using Glove.
For the multi-class model, we have used LSTM (Long Short Term Memory), a special Recurring Neural Network.

The 13 different emotions in the dataset are-
empty
sadness
enthusiasm
neutral
worry
suprise
love
fun
hate
happiness
boredom
relief
anger
